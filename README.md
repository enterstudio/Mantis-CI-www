www submodule for the Travis-CI phonegap app, which has an [Android wrappper](https://github.com/floydpink/Travis-CI) now, and hopefully, would soon have wrappers for other platforms!

Check this out on the [web](http://floydpink.github.com/Travis-CI-www/) or read more about the [android app](http://floydpink.github.com/Travis-CI/).
